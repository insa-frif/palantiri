# Palantiri

## Description

Palantiri is a service library based on the library Palantiri-interfaces

## Current utility

For the moment, we are a little bit busy with Omni-Chat. We believe that this repo can still be useful for a lot of thing, but we don't have the time to develop it right now.
This means that nobody can use it for the moment.

## Install

````bash
npm link palantiri-interfaces
npm install
gulp install.noNpm
gulp build.node
````
